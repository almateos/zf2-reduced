/**
 * Resource extractor class is used to detach resources from original PDF document.
 *
 * It provides resources sharing, so different pages or other PDF resources can share
 * its dependent resources (e.g. fonts or images) or other resources still use them without duplication.
 * It also reduces output PDF size, required memory for PDF processing and
 * processing time.
 *
 * The same extractor may be used for different source documents, several
 * extractors may be used for constracting one target document, but extractor
 * must not be shared between target documents.
